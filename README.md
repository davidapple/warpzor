# Warpzor
The best and most affordable cold storage you will find!

Create a warpwallet bitcoin address, the same as keybase.io/warp
And allows your airgapped android phone to sign a raw transaction using a warpwallet passphrase.
Only communicates using qr codes.
To be built using cordova

# How to use

Install the apk on an android phone.

# Create a Vault

Use the Vault function to create a secure bitcoin address
Your passphrase should be long.
Add your email to protect yourself against undirect bruteforce attacks

# Spend from a vault

Create a transaction using the excellent coinb.in website (other ways are possible as long as you can get the QR code of the raw transaction)
scan the transaction with warpzor
sign it using your warp password/email combination
warpzor will show you a qrcode with your raw transaction (warpzor might show you multiple qr codes if the transaction is too long for a single qrcode)
Scan, with an online device (phone, computer) and double check the transaction before pushing (you can use blockchain.info/pushtx or blockr.io/tx/push)
Again, please double check the transaction before pushing...

# Naturally, use at your own risks!
